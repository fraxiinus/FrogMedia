Hi, I am a Froggian virus but because of poor technology in my pond unfortunately I am not able to harm your computer. Please be so kind as to delete one of your important files yourself and then forward me to other users. Many thanks for your cooperation! Best regards, Froggian virus	0	5	0

Hey frogs. This is my very first copy pasta and I am really nervous about pasting it because if it does not get copy pasta then I will have much embarrassment. I've have thinking about it for a couple of nights now, but here it is!.	0	5	0

Don't let this reptilian conflict distract you from the fact that in 19XX, The Underfrogger threw Frogkind off Hell In A Pond, and plummeted 16 ft through a lilypad. #Frogkind	0	5	0
My Grandfrogger smoked poison darts his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate from froggerversity, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through. I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a dart. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because your post gave me cancer anyway.	0	5	0
What the frog did you just frogging say about me, you little tadpole? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret fraids (frog raids), and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in amphibian warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire pond army.	0	5	0

Did you ever hear the tragedy of Dart Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. #FrogWars #FropCulture	0	5	0
It's not a story the Frog would tell you. It's a Snake legend. Dart Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Snake, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life.. #FrogWars #FropCulture	0	5	0
Water. Earth. Fire. Air. Long ago, the four ponds lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Fire Pond attacked. Only the Froggatar, master of all four elements, could stop them, but when the world needed him most, he vanished. #Froggatar #FirePond	0	5	0
